Welcome!
My name is Alexa Leigh Rome.
I’m a Peruvian-American archaeologist interested in ancient and modern health, ancient DNA (aDNA), prehistoric Americas, modern Indigenous issues and rural health!
I’ve worked on field projects in the USA (southwest and northeast), Malawi, and in the Lima, Chachapoyas, Iquitos regions of Peru.
Additionally, I’ve worked on research projects in labs and museums, including with MALAAP/MEMSAP (formerly Emory University, now Yale University), Lindo Ancient DNA Laboratory (Emory University), Duraisingh Laboratory (Harvard University), IAIS (Insitute for American Indian Studies), and others!

This blog is intended to chronicle some of my field experiences, highlight research of interest, and help share opportunities for the public to get involved in archaeology, cultural heritage, and preservation. 

Thanks for visiting!
